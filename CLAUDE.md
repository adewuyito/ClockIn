# StellarRep — Project Context for Claude Code

> Working name: **StellarRep**. Rename freely — if you do, update this header and the Xcode/SPM product name together so they don't drift apart.

## This is the umbrella repo

StellarRep is split across four repos under the [`StellarRep`](https://github.com/StellarRep) GitHub org:

| Repo | Holds |
|---|---|
| [`StellarRep/StellarRep`](https://github.com/StellarRep/StellarRep) | This repo — `CLAUDE.md` (you are here) and top-level project context. No code. |
| [`StellarRep/contracts`](https://github.com/StellarRep/contracts) | The Soroban `reputation` contract (Rust). |
| [`StellarRep/app`](https://github.com/StellarRep/app) | The native iOS app (Swift/SwiftUI, SPM-first). |
| [`StellarRep/docs`](https://github.com/StellarRep/docs) | `ROADMAP.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTRACT_SPEC.md`, `APP_SPEC.md`. |

This was a **monorepo through Phase 5** (contract + app + docs in one checkout — see the Phase 0 status entry below, and every path mentioned in the phase log through Phase 5 is relative to that single checkout, not to this umbrella repo). It was split after Phase 5 via `git subtree split`, so `contracts/`, `app/`, and `docs/` each carry their own filtered slice of the original commit history into their new repo, rather than starting fresh. If you're picking up work on the contract or the app, clone the relevant repo directly — this one has no source in it anymore.

## What this is

A native iOS app (Swift) backed by a Soroban smart contract (Rust) that gives gig and freelance workers a **portable, on-chain reputation record on Stellar** — job counts and ratings that live on-chain instead of being locked inside one marketplace's private database. It's being built as a repo submission to the **Stellar Wave Program** (Drips × Stellar Development Foundation): https://www.drips.network/wave/stellar

## Why this project, why this category

The Wave Program approves repos across a handful of recurring categories: escrow, payments/payroll, RWA/DeFi, crowdfunding, freelance marketplaces. At the time this project was scoped, escrow and payments were heavily saturated (5+ approved repos each — Trustless-Work, SafeTrust front+back, Sub-Rosa, Stellar-Rent, kindfi in escrow alone), while **on-chain identity/reputation had no dedicated entry** in the approved-repo list. OFFER-HUB (an already-approved freelance marketplace) is evidence the underlying use case — freelance/gig work on Stellar — is one the program already funds; this project builds the reputation layer nobody had claimed yet.

Every repo on the approved list at scoping time was TypeScript/web-first with Rust contracts underneath. A genuinely native Swift app is a differentiator on its own, independent of category.

## Current status

**Phase 0 — done.** Git repo initialized (branch `main`); docs moved under `docs/`; Rust 1.97.1 + `wasm32v1-none` target confirmed; `stellar-cli` 27.1.0 installed via Homebrew; `contracts/` scaffolded as a Cargo workspace with the `reputation` contract (`contracts/reputation`), empty build passes (`stellar contract build`, 583-byte wasm); funded testnet dev identity created (alias `stellarrep-dev`, see `contracts/reputation/DEPLOYED.md`); `app/` scaffolded as an SPM-first package (`app/Package.swift`) with `stellar-ios-mac-sdk` 3.10.0 as a dependency — `import stellarsdk` confirmed building both on the macOS host (`swift build`) and for iOS Simulator (`xcodebuild -scheme StellarRep -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator'`). Monorepo confirmed (contract + app in one repo, as this doc set assumes — no split).

**Phase 1 — done.** `WorkerProfile`, `Review`, and `DataKey` defined as `#[contracttype]`s in `contracts/reputation/src/lib.rs` per `docs/CONTRACT_SPEC.md`; `register_worker` implemented (persistent storage, `require_auth` on the worker, emits `WorkerRegistered`). Only the `AlreadyRegistered` error variant is defined so far — the rest of the spec's error set arrives in Phase 2 with the functions that can trigger them. Decision: a second `register_worker` call for the same address returns `AlreadyRegistered` rather than a silent no-op, since a worker's history should only ever move forward via `submit_review`. Two API corrections found against the spec file while implementing (both now reflected in the code, not just here): `#[contracterror]` needs `#[repr(u32)]` plus `Debug, Eq, PartialEq` derives on current `soroban-sdk` (27.0.6), and `#[contractevent]` structs need a `#[topic]`-marked field and an explicit `.publish(&env)` call rather than a bare struct literal. `cargo test` passes (3 tests: first-call success, `AlreadyRegistered` on re-registration, auth actually enforced). `stellar contract build` succeeds — 3378-byte wasm exporting exactly `register_worker`.

**Phase 2 — done.** `submit_review` implemented (`require_auth` on the reviewer, not the worker; rejects self-review, out-of-range ratings, and duplicate `(worker, job_id)`; updates `total_jobs`/`rating_sum`); `get_reputation` and paginated `get_reviews` implemented; remaining `Error` variants (`NotRegistered`, `InvalidRating`, `DuplicateReview`, `SelfReview`) and the `ReviewSubmitted` event added. `get_reviews` on an unregistered worker or one with no reviews returns an empty list rather than an error — pagination over nothing isn't a fault. TTL decision: a private `bump_ttl` helper extends any touched persistent entry (`Worker`, `Review`, `ReviewIds`) to `env.storage().max_ttl()` once its remaining TTL drops below half that max — read live from the network each call rather than hardcoded, since the allowed maximum is a network parameter. `cargo test` passes: 15 tests, one per error variant in the spec (including two explicit auth-enforcement tests using `testutils`, one seeding storage directly to isolate `submit_review`'s auth from `register_worker`'s) plus 4 pagination boundary cases. `stellar contract build` succeeds — 6190-byte wasm exporting all 4 functions.

**Phase 3 — done.** Deployed to testnet: contract ID `CASDNMYRVVFRTCS23GK2M77VP3W2YCB6NXKT33KL5ZIX6VW4W4TYEPOM` (full detail, tx hashes, and identities in `contracts/reputation/DEPLOYED.md`). All four functions manually invoked against the live instance and confirmed correct: `register_worker` and `submit_review` each produced a real tx hash and the expected event; `get_reputation` and `get_reviews` (simulate-only by design, no tx) read back exactly the state the writes produced. Second funded identity `stellarrep-reviewer` created since `submit_review` requires `worker != reviewer`. The optional Swift-bindings generation (`stellar-contract-bindings` 0.5.0b0 via `pipx`) initially failed against this contract's spec; traced to two real upstream bugs (an XDR parser that chokes on any multi-entry spec, and multi-line doc comments breaking the generated Swift) rather than worked around. Both are already fixed on the tool's `main` branch, unreleased — filed [lightsail-network/stellar-contract-bindings#38](https://github.com/lightsail-network/stellar-contract-bindings/issues/38) asking for a release. Generated the bindings by installing from `main` directly; committed at `app/Sources/StellarRep/Generated/ReputationContract.swift`, confirmed compiling via `swift build`. Full detail in `contracts/reputation/DEPLOYED.md`. Repo pushed to GitHub, then transferred to a dedicated org: https://github.com/StellarRep/StellarRep.

**Phase 4 — done.** `KeychainWalletManager` implemented (generate/import/load/delete a wallet keypair; secret seed stored only in Keychain via `kSecClassGenericPassword`, `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock`, never synced to iCloud) and marked `Sendable` (no mutable state, safe to share across actor boundaries). Onboarding flow built: `OnboardingViewModel` (`@MainActor`, drives create-new vs. import-existing, Friendbot funding, and balance loading) and `OnboardingView` (SwiftUI). App entry point (`StellarRepApp`) split into its own SPM target rather than living inside the `StellarRep` library target — SwiftPM links a library's `@main` type into every target that depends on it, including tests, so `@main` inside `StellarRep` broke `swift test` with a duplicate `_main` symbol; `Package.swift` now declares `StellarRep` (library, no `@main`) and `StellarRepApp` (depends on `StellarRep`, holds only the entry point) as separate products, and `OnboardingView` is `public` so the app target can see it across the module boundary. Friendbot funding gated behind `NetworkConfig.isTestnet` (currently a hardcoded `true`, checked at the one call site that matters). 9 tests pass: 8 fast/offline `KeychainWalletManagerTests` plus one deliberately real, unmocked `OnboardingIntegrationTests` test that generates a keypair, funds it via live Friendbot, and confirms a genuine 10,000 XLM balance from Horizon (~19s) — this is what actually proves the Phase 4 "done when" bar rather than a mocked stand-in. Verified building on macOS host (`swift build`, `swift test`) and iOS Simulator for both schemes (`StellarRep` and `StellarRepApp`).

**Phase 5 — done.** `ReputationService` wraps the Phase 3 generated `ReputationContract` client behind `ReputationServiceProtocol` (`registerWorker`, `submitReview`, `getReputation`, `getReviews`) using app-facing `WorkerProfile`/`Review` models, never exposing generated or `stellarsdk` types to ViewModels. Contract-vs-network error distinction confirmed empirically, not assumed: calling `register_worker` twice throws `AssembledTransactionError.simulationFailed` with message text containing `Error(Contract, #1)` — `ReputationService.run(_:)` regex-extracts that code and maps it to a typed `ReputationServiceError.contract(ReputationContractErrorError)`, distinct from `.network(String)`. `ContractCallState<Success>` (`.idle`/`.pending`/`.succeeded`/`.failed`) is the reusable pending/failed pattern every future contract-calling ViewModel should use; `RegistrationViewModel` is the first real consumer (registers a wallet as a worker — no View yet, that's Phase 6). Found and fixed a real bug in the mocked tests along the way: a `Task.yield()`-based synchronization guess between the test and a controllable mock was an actual race (silently no-op'd the resume, hanging `await task.value` forever) — replaced with a deterministic `AsyncStream`-buffered signal. 14 tests pass total: the existing 9 from Phase 4, 3 fast/offline `RegistrationViewModelTests` proving the pending/contract-error/network-error states individually, and 2 real, unmocked `ReputationServiceIntegrationTests` — one full register → submit_review → get_reputation → get_reviews loop against live testnet through `ReputationService` itself (not the raw generated client), and one confirming a duplicate registration surfaces as the typed `.contract(.AlreadyRegistered)` case end-to-end. Verified on macOS host and iOS Simulator for both schemes.

**Post-Phase-5: split into the multi-repo org layout** described above. `git subtree split --prefix=<dir> -b split-<dir>` on the monorepo, pushed each resulting branch to `main` on the new repo — full history preserved, not squashed. This umbrella repo had `contracts/`, `app/`, `docs/` removed after the split. Next: **Phase 6 — Core UI Flows**, per `docs/ROADMAP.md` (now in the `StellarRep/docs` repo). Update this section as phases complete so anyone (human or Claude) picking this repo back up knows where to resume without re-reading everything.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Smart contract | Rust + `soroban-sdk`, built/deployed via `stellar-cli` | The runtime is still called "Soroban" in tooling and docs even though it's no longer marketed as a separate brand — see `docs/CONTRACT_SPEC.md`. |
| iOS app | Swift, SwiftUI | Native only. No Flutter/RN in this repo — that was the original plan for the underlying concept but this repo is Swift-only. |
| Stellar connectivity | [`stellar-ios-mac-sdk`](https://github.com/Soneso/stellar-ios-mac-sdk) (`import stellarsdk`) | Community-maintained (Soneso), actively developed. Has full Horizon **and** full Soroban RPC coverage as of research time — don't hand-roll a raw JSON-RPC client, this SDK already covers contract simulate/sign/send/poll. |
| Network target (MVP) | Stellar **Testnet** only | No mainnet keys, no mainnet contract ID, no real funds anywhere in this repo until a deliberate later decision. |

## Ground rules

1. **Testnet only until told otherwise.** Never wire in a mainnet secret key or prompt the user for one.
2. **Don't trust hardcoded versions in these docs.** Soroban's SDK major version tracks the network protocol version and moves fast; a version that was current when this doc set was written may not be current when you're actually building. Resolve current versions from crates.io / the SDK repos / SPM at build time. Every place this matters is flagged inline in `CONTRACT_SPEC.md` and `APP_SPEC.md`.
3. **Small, real, and working beats large and mocked.** Wave Program review looks for genuine functionality, not UI mockups. A 3-function contract that actually deploys and passes tests beats a 10-function contract that doesn't compile.
4. **Seed issues as you go.** Getting a repo approved into the Program depends partly on having well-scoped open issues for other contributors to pick up. Phase 7 in the roadmap covers this explicitly, but if a genuine v2 item surfaces earlier (see "Non-goals" in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`), open the issue then rather than batching everything at the end.
5. **This doc set is a starting frame, not gospel.** Where reality — an SDK quirk, a testnet outage, a cleaner pattern you find mid-build — contradicts what's written here, follow reality and update the doc to match. Stale docs are worse than no docs.
